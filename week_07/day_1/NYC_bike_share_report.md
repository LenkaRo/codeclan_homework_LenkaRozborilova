According to the MetroBike's Bike-Sharing Blog, that carried out a vast survey on the bike-sharing programs, in 2018, there were more than 1,500 of such programs in operation worldwide, providing a fleet of more than 18 million bicycles for public use! 

The bicycle sharing systems are with no doubt very popular amongst public and with a clear upward trend, new bike-sharing programs are emerging every year.

In the following presentation I will be sharing with you some insights into the New York Cityâ€™s bike share system - one of the largest bike shares in the USA.

As of 2021, there is currently nearly 15,000 bikes available but for the analysis purpose, we will be looking at data collected on a particular 10 bikes in 2018. Just to note here, for the ethical reasons, the users personal data were erased from the data set and they can not be identified.

Here I've got a data sample available if you're interested in the raw structure of the input data.

In the first graph you can see how many times was EACH bike hired daily on average. 
We can clearly see that the bike hire frequency went up during the summer months, with August being the busiest month of the year. On the other hand, the winter months were the most quiet ones.
(Fun fact, the busiest day of 2018 was the 31st of Jan, with every bike being hired nearly 5 times that day on average!)

In the next graph we are looking at a density plot showing the Typical bike usage throughout a day. This plot is split into two groups - the week days (represented in red colour) and weekend days (represented in green colour).
The most popular bike hire times during the week days were 7-10AM and 5-8PM, and we can see this on these two peaks. So, looking at these rush hours, we can assume that people are using the hired bikes for morning commute to work and than for the commute back home in the evening. The middle of the day is, generally, much less busy.
On the other hand, over the weekend days, the peak is rather flat and kind of spread over the daylight hours, between 10AM-6PM. We can assume that people are enjoying their free time and rather use the hired bikes for leisure purpose and scenery rides.

And now it's your turn, just for fun! Looking at this graph, make a guess, whether people spent more time cycling during the week days, or during the weekend days?

The durations are actually pretty close! At least regarding to our sample of 10 bikes. 14.19 minutes for weekday, 14.79 minutes for a weekend day. So possibly, people are not that rushed over the weekends :)
Maybe, it would be interesting to compare an average pace on a week day vs. weekend day :) But our data set is not that rich to allow us to carry out such statistic.

Each bike was being used for 67 hours on average in 2018. The third graph simply shows us that in 2018, male spent more time cycling using the hired-bikes. 

Here on the map, you can see the locations of all the 55 start and end bike stations across NYC where our sample 10 bikes were docked during 2018. When you click on any pin, it gives you the unique ID for the each station.

Finaly, lets have a wee look at two models forecasting how many times on average is each bike going to be used daily in the firt three months of 2019. So just an extension to our very first graph.

In conclusion, we dealt with the data from NYC's Bike Share System from 2018. We saw that the system is popular amongst people. Bikes are used regularly with likely enough bikes in the network to respond the demand as each bike was only used up to 5 times a day in the peak months. The system showed seasonal character with the demand increasing during the summer months. We saw the bikes are similarly popular during week days and weekend days. And that male utilize the NYC Bike Share System slightly more.
