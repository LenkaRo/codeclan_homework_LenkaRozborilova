# Shiny - Weekend homework
# 
# In the CodeClanData package there is a dataset called game_sales. 
# It contains information about world wide video game sales.
# 
# We want you to create an interactive visualisation(s) of this data using Shiny - 
#     use the tools learned through the lessons on ggplot and Shiny to create the visualisation, 
#     and it should have at least one iteractive element where the user can change the visualisation 
#     (for example via a widget).
# 
# Itâ€™s completely up to you which elements of the data you focus on. 
# Please add a small comment with the code of each of your graphs/visuals to explain 
# why you picked viewing the data in this way and what insight you hope the user will gain from it. 
# This is great practice for the group project of starting to think about WHY you are plotting the data 
# and thinking about what insights and decisions do you want the dashboard users to get from it.

#View(game_sales)

# Shiny app
### Layout - Tab 1: Video games, two selectInput widgets, two output bar charts, reactive functionality (action button)
###          Tab 2: Meme image, website link

## User Interface
